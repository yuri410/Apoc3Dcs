        // The particles array and vertex buffer are treated as a circular queue.
        // Initially, the entire contents of the array are free, because no particles
        // are in use. When a new particle is created, this is allocated from the
        // beginning of the array. If more than one particle is created, these will
        // always be stored in a consecutive block of array elements. Because all
        // particles last for the same amount of time, old particles will always be
        // removed in order from the start of this active particle region, so the
        // active and free regions will never be intermingled. Because the queue is
        // circular, there can be times when the active particle region wraps from the
        // end of the array back to the start. The queue uses modulo arithmetic to
        // handle these cases. For instance with a four entry queue we could have:
        //
        //      0
        //      1 - first active particle
        //      2 
        //      3 - first free particle
        //
        // In this case, particles 1 and 2 are active, while 3 and 4 are free.
        // Using modulo arithmetic we could also have:
        //
        //      0
        //      1 - first free particle
        //      2 
        //      3 - first active particle
        //
        // Here, 3 and 0 are active, while 1 and 2 are free.
        //
        // But wait! The full story is even more complex.
        //
        // When we create a new particle, we add them to our managed particles array.
        // We also need to copy this new data into the GPU vertex buffer, but we don't
        // want to do that straight away, because setting new data into a vertex buffer
        // can be an expensive operation. If we are going to be adding several particles
        // in a single frame, it is faster to initially just store them in our managed
        // array, and then later upload them all to the GPU in one single call. So our
        // queue also needs a region for storing new particles that have been added to
        // the managed array but not yet uploaded to the vertex buffer.
        //
        // Another issue occurs when old particles are retired. The CPU and GPU run
        // asynchronously, so the GPU will often still be busy drawing the previous
        // frame while the CPU is working on the next frame. This can cause a
        // synchronization problem if an old particle is retired, and then immediately
        // overwritten by a new one, because the CPU might try to change the contents
        // of the vertex buffer while the GPU is still busy drawing the old data from
        // it. Normally the graphics driver will take care of this by waiting until
        // the GPU has finished drawing inside the VertexBuffer.SetData call, but we
        // don't want to waste time waiting around every time we try to add a new
        // particle! To avoid this delay, we can specify the SetDataOptions.NoOverwrite
        // flag when we write to the vertex buffer. This basically means "I promise I
        // will never try to overwrite any data that the GPU might still be using, so
        // you can just go ahead and update the buffer straight away". To keep this
        // promise, we must avoid reusing vertices immediately after they are drawn.
        //
        // So in total, our queue contains four different regions:
        //
        // Vertices between firstActiveParticle and firstNewParticle are actively
        // being drawn, and exist in both the managed particles array and the GPU
        // vertex buffer.
        //
        // Vertices between firstNewParticle and firstFreeParticle are newly created,
        // and exist only in the managed particles array. These need to be uploaded
        // to the GPU at the start of the next draw call.
        //
        // Vertices between firstFreeParticle and firstRetiredParticle are free and
        // waiting to be allocated.
        //
        // Vertices between firstRetiredParticle and firstActiveParticle are no longer
        // being drawn, but were drawn recently enough that the GPU could still be
        // using them. These need to be kept around for a few more frames before they
        // can be reallocated.
